SECTION 10 — WHAT AGREEMENTS ARE CONTRACTS
All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not expressly declared to be void.

Essential elements of a valid contract:
1. Offer and acceptance
2. Free consent (Section 14)
3. Competency of parties (Section 11)
4. Lawful consideration (Section 23)

6. Not expressly declared void

SECTION 11 — WHO ARE COMPETENT TO CONTRACT
Every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority (18 years), who is of sound mind, and who is not disqualified from contracting by any law.
A minor's agreement is VOID AB INITIO (Mohori Bibee vs Dharmodas Ghose, 1903).

SECTION 14 — FREE CONSENT
Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by:
(1) Coercion (Section 15): Committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code, or unlawfully detaining or threatening to detain any property.

(4) Misrepresentation (Section 18): Positive assertion of a fact which is not warranted by information of the person making it, though he believes it to be true; breach of duty which gains an advantage; causing a party to make a mistake as to the subject matter.
(5) Mistake (Sections 20-22): Both parties are under mistake of fact essential to the agreement (Section 20 — void); unilateral mistake does not make the agreement void (Section 22).

SECTION 24 — AGREEMENTS VOID IF CONSIDERATIONS UNLAWFUL IN PART
If any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of several considerations for a single object, is unlawful, the agreement is void.

SECTION 25 — AGREEMENT WITHOUT CONSIDERATION IS VOID
An agreement without consideration is void unless:

SECTION 73 — COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY BREACH OF CONTRACT
When a contract has been broken, the party who suffers is entitled to receive compensation for loss or damage caused by the breach, as naturally arose in the usual course of things, or which the parties knew when they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach.

SECTION 74 — COMPENSATION FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT WHERE PENALTY IS STIPULATED
When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled to receive from the party who has broken the contract, reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named.

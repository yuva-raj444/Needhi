PART 5: WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN INDIA
=============================================

Key principles recognised by Indian courts:

   bear children. (X vs Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Delhi HC, 2022)

2. BODILY INTEGRITY: No one can force a woman to continue or terminate a pregnancy.
   Forced sterilisation is a human rights violation.

3. CONTRACEPTION ACCESS: Right to access contraception is part of right to health.

4. SPACING OF CHILDREN: Government's two-child policy cannot be imposed through
   denial of benefits (Supreme Court cases on this).

FORCED STERILISATION:
National Human Rights Commission has taken cases against forced sterilisations.
Forced sterilisation violates Article 21 (Right to Life and Dignity).
Any doctor who performs sterilisation without consent faces criminal liability.

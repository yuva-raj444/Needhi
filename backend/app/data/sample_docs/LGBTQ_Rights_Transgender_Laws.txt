THE JUDGMENT:
The Supreme Court of India unanimously struck down the application of
Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to consensual same-sex relations
between adults in private.

WHAT SECTION 377 WAS:
Section 377 IPC made "carnal intercourse against the order of nature"
a criminal offence punishable with up to 10 years imprisonment.
It was used to criminalise same-sex relations for over 150 years.

WHAT THE COURT RULED:
1. Section 377 was UNCONSTITUTIONAL to the extent it criminalised
   consensual sexual conduct between adults.
2. It violated Articles 14 (Equality), 15 (Non-discrimination),
   19 (Freedom of expression) and 21 (Right to life and dignity).
3. "Sexual orientation is innate and immutable."
4. "History owes an apology to LGBTQ+ persons."

WHAT REMAINS CRIMINALISED:
- Non-consensual sexual acts (all genders)
- Sexual acts with minors (all genders)
- Section 377 still applies to these

IMPACT:
- LGBTQ+ persons can no longer be arrested merely for their sexual orientation
- Police cannot use Section 377 to harass or arrest gay men
- LGBTQ+ persons have equal dignity under law

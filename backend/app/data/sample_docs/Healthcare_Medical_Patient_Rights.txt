Supreme Court held that doctors and hospitals providing medical services are
"service providers" under Consumer Protection Act and can be sued for deficiency.

Supreme Court held that mere error of judgment is NOT negligence. There must be
a clear departure from accepted standards.

homicide shall be punished with imprisonment for 2 years or fine or both.

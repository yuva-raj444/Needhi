DEFAMATION DEFINED:
Whoever by words spoken or written, signs, or visible representation,
makes or publishes any imputation about a person knowing or having reason
to believe it will harm that person's reputation, commits defamation.

TRUTH IS COMPLETE DEFENCE in civil defamation.
In criminal defamation, truth must also be in public interest.

PART 5: ELECTION LAWS AND MEDIA
=================================

REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE ACT, 1951:
Model Code of Conduct during elections — restricts government from
announcing new schemes during election period.

PAID NEWS:
Publishing favourable coverage as news without disclosing it is paid — is an
electoral corrupt practice and can lead to disqualification of candidates.
Election Commission of India (ECI) regulates this.

EXIT POLLS:
Cannot be published until the last phase of voting ends.
Prohibited during voting hours under Section 126A of Representation of People Act.

PART 6: MEDIA AND PRIVACY
===========================

STING OPERATIONS:
Not expressly regulated by law in India.
Courts have held: Public interest is the test — if serving genuine public interest
and method is not disproportionate, they may be protected.
But sting operations that violate privacy without public interest can attract:
- IT Act Section 66E (capturing private images)
- IPC Section 499 (defamation)

RIGHT TO PRIVACY OF PUBLIC FIGURES:
While public figures have reduced privacy in their public roles, they retain
privacy in their personal and family matters.
R. Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu (1994): Landmark case — publications
about private life without consent violates right to privacy.

PART 7: JOURNALISTS' RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS
=============================================

PRESS ACCREDITATION:
Government gives press accreditation cards to reporters for coverage.
No accreditation is required to practice journalism in India (unlike
many other countries) — journalism is a free profession.

SHIELD LAWS (Source Protection):
India does NOT have a dedicated shield law.
BUT courts have recognised some protection of journalist sources
in specific circumstances (based on Article 19(1)(a)).

ARRESTS OF JOURNALISTS:
Several journalists have faced FIRs under:
- Sedition (Section 124A IPC — now BNS Section 152) — Constitutionality challenged
- UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act)
- IT Act Section 66A (now struck down by Shreya Singhal judgment)

LEGAL SUPPORT FOR JOURNALISTS:
- Press Club of India: New Delhi (pressclubindia.org)
- Editors Guild of India: editorsguild.in
- Foundation for Media Professionals: lawyerscollective.org/fmp

PART 8: SEDITION LAW IN INDIA (CURRENT STATUS)
================================================

SECTION 124A IPC (SEDITION):
Originally: "Whoever by words, signs, visible representations excites
or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government shall be
punished with imprisonment for life."

IMPORTANT UPDATE:
In May 2022, the Supreme Court directed that sedition cases be
put on hold and governments not to file new cases under Section 124A IPC
until the law is reconsidered.

BHARATIYA NYAYA SANHITA (BNS) 2023:
Section 124A IPC (sedition) has been repealed in BNS.
Instead, BNS Section 152 covers "acts endangering sovereignty or unity of India"
which is a NEW and broader provision.

CURRENT STATUS:
BNS Section 152 covers: Exciting secession, rebellion, subversive activities,
endangering sovereignty.
Punishment: Life imprisonment or 7 years imprisonment.

Critics argue this is effectively a replacement for sedition with even broader scope.

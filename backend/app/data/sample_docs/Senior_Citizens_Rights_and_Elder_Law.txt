SENIOR CITIZENS RIGHTS, MAINTENANCE LAWS AND ELDER CARE IN INDIA
=================================================================

PART 1: MAINTENANCE AND WELFARE OF PARENTS AND SENIOR CITIZENS ACT, 2007
=========================================================================

APPLICABILITY:
- "Senior Citizen" means a person who has attained the age of 60 years or above.
- "Parent" includes biological parents, adoptive parents, and step-parents.
- Applies to all citizens of India regardless of religion.

WHO MUST MAINTAIN:
1. Adult children (including daughters) MUST maintain their parents and
   senior citizen parents-in-law (if the senior citizen is widowed).
2. If a person has no children, then grand-children who have inherited or
   stand to inherit property must maintain.
3. A childless senior citizen can also be maintained by relatives who
   inherit or stand to inherit the senior citizen's property.

AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE:
Monthly maintenance up to Rs. 10,000 per month can be ordered (some
states have increased this limit through amendments — e.g., Rajasthan,
Maharashtra). The tribunal considers:
- Needs of the senior citizen
- Income of the person liable to maintain
- Standard of living

HOW TO FILE FOR MAINTENANCE:
1. Apply to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) of your area.
2. Maintenance Tribunal (SDM) hears the case.
3. Order passed within 90 days.
4. Tribunal can order monthly payment.
5. If order not followed: Imprisonment up to 1 month.

IMPORTANT: This is a MUCH FASTER process than filing a civil suit.

RIGHT TO RECLAIM PROPERTY:
If a senior citizen has transferred property to children on the condition
of receiving maintenance AND the children fail to provide maintenance,
the transfer can be declared VOID by the Tribunal.
This applies even if property was gifted.

  home if the children are not taking care of them.
